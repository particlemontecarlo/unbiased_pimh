running 'sv_get_estimators.R' should do the job of getting estimators and shrinking them
down to something reasonable

-> then need to run sv_plot_inefficiencies.R


sv_plot_inefficiencies.R is made of some code taken from sv_plot_results.R
sv_plot_results.R has the plotting code for both experiments - so the k=K=0 also
